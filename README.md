- 👋 Hi there, I’m Etra!
   
- 👀 I’m interested in just about everything the world of technology has to offer...
  
- 🌱 I’m currently developing an application framework in Rust, along with a game to be used with it.  

- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now, as I have no experience in doing so...  Although I am happy to consider any invites!
  
- 📫 Feel free to reach me @etra.me@protonmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: A squirrel is currently watching you...

- ☀️ Have a lovely day!
